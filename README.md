# Project Status
uTLS was initially developed by Sergey Frolov during an internship at Jigsaw.

This code is no longer being mainatained, but the Refraction Networking team has forked it and, as of October 2018, appears to be continuing development [here](https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls).

You can view the last version of this repo's code at [this link](https://github.com/jigsaw-code/uTLS/tree/master)
